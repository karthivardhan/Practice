Variables:-
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
  a and A - 2 variables
- If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
  int, str, float
- You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
- Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
  x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
- you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
  x = y = z = "Orange"
- If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables.
This is called unpacking.
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  x, y, z = fruits
