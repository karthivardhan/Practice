Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects



Polymorphism: is the ability of the code to take multiple forms. Let’s say,
if the parent class has a method named XYZ then the child class can also have a method with the same
name XYZ having its own variables and parameters.

Encapsulation: in Python refers to the process of wrapping up the variables and different functions
into a single entity or capsule.Python class is the best example of encapsulation in python.

A lambda:
 function is an anonymous function (a function that does not have a name) in Python.
 To define anonymous functions, we use the ‘lambda’ keyword instead of the ‘def’ keyword

l = lambda x,y : x*y
print(a(5, 6))


1. Explain the different exceptions in Selenium WebDriver.
TimeoutException: This exception is thrown when a command performing an operation does not complete in the stipulated
time.
NoSuchElementException: This exception is thrown when an element with given attributes is not found on the web page.
ElementNotVisibleException: This exception is thrown when the element is present in DOM (Document Object Model),
but not visible on the web page.
StaleElementException: This exception is thrown when the element is either deleted or no longer attached to the DOM.

2. What is POM (Page Object Model)? What are its advantages?
Page Object Model is a design pattern for creating an Object Repository for web UI elements.

The advantages of using POM are:
Allows us to separate operations and flows in the UI from Verification – improves code readability
Since the Object Repository is independent of Test Cases, multiple tests can use the same Object Repository
Reusability of code
